## 2degrees

2degrees sites almost always have a red on white caution sign on or near the base station cabinet, similar to the one below, with the 2degrees site ID. Many older sites had signs with the name 'NZ Communications' which is the name they operated under prior to their public launch. However these have mostly been replaced with 2degrees ones in recent times.

2degrees sites usually use Huwawei cabinets which can be seen on the left in the below photo. Note that Spark has started using their cabinets as well in recent times. Some sites also have another cabinet for the power supply which is shown on the right in the photo below.

## Spark

Some Spark cell sites bult during the time of Telecom ownership may have signs like the following. Note that many Telecom cell sites did not have those signs so the absence of any signs at all is a good indicator of a Spark cell site.

Many older Spark NZ cell sites built during the time of Telecom ownership were built next to telephone exchanges.

Some cell sites had shipping containers to house the base station gear.

## Woosh

Woosh is no longer operating in most of the areas it used to operate in. However many of their equipment are still in situ in major cities. Some have since been removed, usually due to the land owner redeveloping the land.

Some Woosh cell sites have a warning sign similar to the below on or near their cabinet.

Woosh, as a new entrant, often co-located with another operator. When they co-located on a tower, their eqipment would typically be placed below the host operator.

Woosh almost always used cabinets to house their equipment, typically cream coloured.

However sometimes they are green.
