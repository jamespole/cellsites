## 2degrees

2degrees cell sites typically have red on white caution signs. It will look like the one below. Usually it will show the 2degrees site ID. Older sites had signs with the name 'NZ Communications' which is the name they operated under prior to their public launch. However these have been replaced with 2degrees.

Newer 2degrees cell sites usually use Huwawei cabinets which can be seen on the left in the below photo. Huawei cabinets have distinctive rounded corners.  Note that Spark also uses these Huawei cabinets. Some sites have a different type of cabinet for the power supply which is shown in the middle in the photo below.

Important 2degrees cell sites located on buildings will have a place for generators to provide power supply in case of a power failure. Usually it'll be at the bottom of the building in a place with easy access for vehicles (e.g. loading spaces, car parks, etc).

## Woosh

Woosh is no longer operating in most of the areas it used to operate in. However many of their equipment are still in situ in major cities. Some have since been removed, usually due to the land owner redeveloping the land.

Some Woosh cell sites have a warning sign similar to the below on or near their cabinet.

Woosh, as a new entrant, often co-located with another operator. When they co-located on a tower, their eqipment would typically be placed below the host operator.

Woosh almost always used cabinets to house their equipment, typically cream coloured.
