## Signs

Most Vodafone cell sites will have a white warning sign similar to the below near the base station hut or cabinet.

Newer sites have a small `SITE I.D.` sign. It is often affixed on top of the warning sign as below.

## Generator Inlets

Important cell sites located on buildings will have a place for generators to provide power supply in case of a power failure. Usually it'll be at the bottom of the building in a place with easy access for vehicles (e.g. loading spaces, car parks, etc).

## Power Meters

Some older Vodafone NZ cell sites built during the time of BellSouth owership will have a power meter labelled `BELL SOUTH`. These older cell sites often have the ability to be powered from an external generator via a power socket.
