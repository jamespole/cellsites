An interesting feature of this cell site is that the backhaul (i.e. connection to the switching centre) was via a
Telecom line. At the time BellSouth established this site (in the early 1990's) they used wireless microwave for their
backhaul as much as they could. Only a select few sites were backhauled over the Telecom network in those days.

Note the grey Telecom terminal post showing this site is line-fed rather than microwave-fed.
