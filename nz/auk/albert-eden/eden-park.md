# Eden Park

Eden Park is apparently the site of New Zealand's largest Distributed Antennas System (DAS). It appears that Spark and
Vodafone jointly established the system while 2degrees may have gone have gone with a more traditional approach. I've
included some links at the end of this page to web pages and documents of interest related to this DAS deployment.

## Entry D

* **Date:** 14 October 2016

A newer photo of the installation near Entry D. The DAS antenna looks like it has some sort of device below it. Around
this time Spark added 700 MHz and 2600 Mhz LTE services which may have needed adjustments to the equipment.
