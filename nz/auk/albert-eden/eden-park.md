# Eden Park

Eden Park is apparently the site of New Zealand's largest Distributed Antennas System (DAS). It appears that Spark and
Vodafone jointly established the system while 2degrees may have gone have gone with a more traditional approach. I've
included some links at the end of this page to web pages and documents of interest.

* **[Entry A](#entry-a)**
* **[Entry D](#entry-d)**
* **[Entry K](#entry-k)**

## Entry A

* **Date:** 17 September 2015
* **Operators:** Spark and Vodafone

Near Entry A is an antenna with a down-tilt. It is difficult to find but if you zoom into the top-right of the roof to
the left of the field, you can see the antenna.

## Entry D

* **Date:** 17 September 2015
* **Operators:** Spark, 2degrees and Vodafone

Near Entry D were two antennas, both with a down-tilt. My guess is the antenna on the left ia part of the Distributed
Antenna System (DAS) that provides Spark and Vodafone service and the antenna on the right is for 2degrees.

What seems like WiFi atennas can also be seen on the red ceiling in the foreground.

* **Date:** 14 October 2016

A newer photo of the installation near Entry D. The DAS antenna looks like it has some sort of device below it. Around
this time Spark added 700 MHz and 2600 Mhz LTE services which may have needed adjustments to the equipment.

## Entry K

* **Date:** 17 September 2015
* **Operators:** Spark and Vodafone

Near Entry K are two antennas for the Distributed Antenna System (DAS) that provides Spark and Vodafone services.

The two antennas are fed by a FlexWave Prism Remote Unit. The Remote Unit is linked with a Host Unit in another
location by a digital-over-fiber connection.
