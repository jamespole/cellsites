## New Bond Street

* **Date:** 3 July 2009
* **Operators:** NZ Communications, Telecom and Vodafone

View looking East along State Highway 16. **From left:** Telecom (4 panel antennas), Vodafone (2 panel antennas) and NZ
Communications (1 panel antenna). Telecom's shipping container for their equipment can be seen on the ground left. On
the ground right is cabinets for NZ Communications (green, front) and Vodafone (grey, behind). Also visible is
Telecom's GPS antenna at the base of the light pole above NZ Communication's cabinet.

View looking North along the Bond Road bridge. The shiny green cabinet for the NZ Communications network can be seen
on the left. Next to it is a grey cabinet for Vodafone and behind is a shipping container for Telecom. Also visible in
the foreground along the bridge is a shiny new bracket which would later hold a dish antenna for a microwave link to
another cell site.

* **Date:** 4 December 2015
* **Operators:** Spark, 2degrees and Vodafone

View looking East along State Highway 16. Over five years later, what has changed? Telecom is now Spark.
NZ Communications has come out as 2degrees. Spark's old panel antennas for CDMA services have gone, replaced with
panel antennas for LTE services (seen here as the third panel antenna from left) and LTE remote radio units (seen here
to the right of the LTE antenna). No change to the 2degrees and Vodafone equipment.

View looking West along State Highway 16. Not long after the 2009 photos, NZ Communications installed two dish antennas
for their microwave links to the Arch Hill (right-most dish antenna) and Dominion Road (left) cell sites.
