## Spotless Facility

* **Date:** 27 February 2011
* **Operator:** Telecom and 2degrees

**From left:** Cell site at [Building 017](#building-017) in background and this cell site in foreground. 2degrees
microwave dishes on top, 2degrees antennas in centre and Telecom antennas at bottom. At bottom of structure there was
an equipment hut for Telecom (left), equipment cabinet for Telecom (right) and 2degrees equipment cabinet (behind
right).

Note lack of Telecom antennas on left side of structure due to coverage already provided by the [Alberta
Street](./point-chevalier#alberta-street) cell siteâ€”however 2degrees has provided 360 degrees coverage from this cell
site depsite having another cell site of its own nearby. The number of microwave dishes belonging to 2degrees indicates
that this site was a major microwave hub for them.
