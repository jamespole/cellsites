## 454 Puhinui Road

* **Date:** 18 October 2016
* **Operator:** Spark

Spark monopole on right with equipment cabinet at its base. Spark also has a equipment shelter opposite the road (green
building in left-centre of photo) which I suspect is no longer in use having been replaced with the equipment cabinet
closer to the base. The 2degrees cell site at [485 Puhiui Road](#485-puhinui-road) can be spotted in the left of the
photo.

## 485 Puhinui Road

* **Date:** 18 October 2016
* **Operator:** 2degrees

2degrees cell site at far left. Interestingly this cell site seems to be located on a residential property—a very
unusual arrangement. The Spark cell site at [454 Puhinui Road](#454-puhinui-road) can be seen on the right. This cell
site had a microwave link to the cell site on top of the International Terminal at Auckland Airport.

## 555 Puhinui Road

* **Date:** 18 October 2016
* **Operator:** Vodafone

Thanks to [Malaysia Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines) for photo-bombing this photo! In
reality, I did on purpose to show how close this cell site is to the flight paths for Auckland Airport.

## Station Road

* **Date:** 5 April 2012
* **Operators:** 2degrees and Vodafone

I beleive this was one of the first examples of 2degrees co-locating their gear on top of a Vodafone tower, heralding
the start of a more co-operative era in New Zealand. 2degrees had a microwave link to the [Amersham
Way](./manukau#amersham-way) cell site.
