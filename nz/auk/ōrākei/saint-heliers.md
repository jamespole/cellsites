* **Date:** 14 January 2012

View of the [Waimarie Street](#waimarie-street) cell site. Interesting to note that Telecom chose not to co-locate with
other operators at that cell site. However Telecom's cell site benefits from more natural shielding to the West. This
helps to limit the service area of this cell site to the East.

Eagled eyed observers will note that the Waimarie Street has a new operator, 2degrees.

## Waimarie Street

* **Date:** 8 January 2004
* **Operators:** Vodafone (microwave linking only) and Woosh

Woosh panel antenna on front of tower (also two more on other side all in a typical 120&deg; configuration). Two dish
antennas can just be seen at top-right linking Vodafone's St Heliers Bay site with the Glendowie site. It would be some
time before Vodafone started using this site for more than just microwave linking!

No notable changes from the previous visit. This photo has a better view of Vodafone's dish antennas. Woosh also had
dish antennas but they are on the other side of the water tower.

* **Date:** 18 January 2015
* **Operators:** 2degrees, Vodafone (linking only) and Woosh

What a difference now! 2degrees is here with their wide panel antennas (alongside Woosh's narrower antennas). 2degrees
have also used this site for microwave linking as well.

Microwave dishes from left: Two dishes for Vodafone to PriceWaterhouseCoopers Building(?), 2degrees to Remuera Hub,
Vodafone to St Heliers Bay, Vodafone to Glendowie (decommissioned as I presume the PWC link would have make this
redundant?) and Woosh to Remuera Hub.  On the other side 2degrees also has a microwave link Musik Point.

* **Date:** 7 January 2016
* **Operators:** 2degrees, Vodafone and Woosh(?)

Some more changes! Vodafone has finally deployed antennas for mobile services, the first time they have done so after
over a decade at this site. 2degrees and Woosh's antennas remain unchanged. Vodafone has finally replaced an old dish
for the St Heliers Bay link with a new one (which would soon later be decommisioned after they relocated the other
end to a line-fed site).
