View of [Waimarie Street](#waimarie-street) cell site. Telecom did not co-locate with other operators there. Telecom's
cell site benefits from natural shielding to the West. This limits the service area of this cell site to the East.
Eagle-eyed observers will note Waimarie Street has a new operator, 2degrees.

## Waimarie Street

* **Date:** 8 January 2004
* **Operators:** Vodafone (backhaul only) and Woosh

Woosh panel antenna on front of tower. There also two more, in a typical 120&deg; configuration. Vodafone had two dish
antennas at the top-right. One dish pointed at the isolated St Heliers Bay cell site. The other dish pointed at their
major microwave hub at Glendowie. Vodafone actually had no mobile services from this site and only used this site as a
relay station for its backhaul network. It would be some time before Vodafone started using this site for more than
just backhaul!

No notable changes from the previous visit. This photo has a better view of Vodafone's dish antennas. Woosh also had
a dish antenna but it was on the other side of the water tower. There is a later photo below with a better view of
Woosh's dish antenna.

* **Date:** 18 October 2015
* **Operators:** 2degrees, Vodafone (linking only) and Woosh

What a difference now! 2degrees is here with their wide panel antennas (alongside Woosh's narrower antennas). 2degrees
have also used this site for microwave linking as well.

**Microwave dishes from left:** Two dishes for Vodafone to PriceWaterhouseCoopers Building(?), 2degrees to Remuera Hub,
Vodafone to St Heliers Bay, Vodafone to Glendowie (decommissioned as I presume the PWC link would have make this
redundant?) and Woosh to [416 Remuera Road](remuera#416-remuera-road). On the other side 2degrees also has a microwave
link to Musick Point.

* **Date:** 7 January 2016
* **Operators:** 2degrees, Vodafone and Woosh(?)

Only three and a half months later and more changes! Vodafone has finally deployed antennas for mobile services, the
first time they have done so after more than a decade at this site. 2degrees and Woosh's antennas remain unchanged.
Vodafone has replaced the dish for the St Heliers Bay link with a new one. That dish would later be decommisioned after
they relocated the cell site at the other end to a line-fed site. The dish for the Glendowie link has gone now becasuse
by that point the Glendowie site had been decommissioned.
