# Saint Heliers

## Waimarie Street

* **Date:** 18 October 2015
* **Operators:** 2degrees, Vodafone (linking only) and Woosh

What a difference now! 2degrees is here with their wide panel antennas (alongside Woosh's narrower antennas). 2degrees
have also used this site for microwave linking as well.

**Microwave dishes from left:** Two dishes for Vodafone to PriceWaterhouseCoopers Building(?), 2degrees to Remuera Hub,
Vodafone to [Saint Heliers Bay](saint-heliers-bay), Vodafone to Glendowie (decommissioned as I presume the PWC link
would have make this redundant?) and Woosh to [416 Remuera Road](remuera#416-remuera-road). On the other side 2degrees
also has a microwave link to Musick Point.

* **Date:** 7 January 2016
* **Operators:** 2degrees, Vodafone and Woosh(?)

Only three and a half months later and more changes! Vodafone has finally deployed antennas for mobile services, the
first time they have done so after more than a decade at this site. 2degrees and Woosh's antennas remain unchanged.
Vodafone has replaced the dish for the [Saint Heliers Bay](saint-heliers-bay) link with a new one. That dish would
later be decommisioned after they relocated the cell site at the other end to a line-fed site. The dish for the
Glendowie link has gone now becasuse by that point the Glendowie site had been decommissioned.
