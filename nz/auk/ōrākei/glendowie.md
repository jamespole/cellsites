## 1-5 Maskell Street

* **Date:** 7 January 2016
* **Operator:** Vodafone

Vodafone relocated to this new cell site from [182-184 Saint Heliers Bay Road](#182-184-saint-heliers-bay-road). This
cell site is just a few doors down from 2degrees' cell site at [15 Maskell Street](#15-maskell-street). Their antennas
are hidden in the dark box on top of the block of shops.

Their equipment cabinet. This can just be seen in the main photo above at ground level below the vet clinic sign.

## 15 Maskell Street

* **Date:** 2 September 2008
* **Operator:** NZ Communications

One of a few handful of sites I managed to photograph before the official launch of the network. Interestingly, this
site is still yet to receive 4G services despite almost every other site in Auckland having had this uprade.

## 182-184 Saint Heliers Bay Road

* **Date:** 28 August 2005
* **Operators:** Telecom and Vodafone

This site was a microwave hub for Vodafone. They had microwave links to the ASB Building hub, [Averill
Avenue](./kohimarama#averill-avenue) cell site, [Highland Park](../howick/#highland-park) cell site, [Michaels
Avenue](../ellerslie#michaels-avenue) cell site, [250 Saint Johns Road](saint-johns#350-saint-johns-road) cell site and
[Waimarie Street](saint-heliers#waimarie-street) cell site. They also provided 2G and 3G services from here as well.
Telecom were also present at this site with their services line-fed via the nearby Glendowie exchange.

* **Date:** 2 September 2008

New panels for Telecom. They had two panels stacked vertically while Vodafone just had the one panel for each sector.

By 2016 both Telecom and Vodafone had relocated elsewhere. Telecom was first to relocate, moving just around the corner
to [208A Saint Heliers Bay Road](#208a-saint-heliers-bay-road). Vodafone later relocated to a nearby shopping village
at [1-5 Maskell Street](#1-5-maskell-street). 2degrees had never had a presence at this site. I suspect by the time
2degrees came along the property owner had decided not to continue with hosting mobile phone operators. 2degrees ended
up choosing a site just down the road from where Vodafone would eventually relocate to.

Here is a picture of both current and former cell sites. Telecom relocated to a site pretty much just around the
corner!
