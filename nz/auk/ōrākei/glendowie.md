One of a few handful of sites I managed to photograph before the official launch of the network. Interestingly, this
site is still yet to receive 4G services despite almost every other site in Auckland having had this uprade.

## 182-184 Saint Heliers Bay Road

* **Date:** 28 August 2005
* **Operators:** Telecom and Vodafone

This site was a microwave hub for Vodafone. They had microwave links to the ASB Building hub, [Averill
Avenue](kohimarama#averill-avenue) cell site, [Highland Park](../howick/#highland-park) cell site, [Michaels
Avenue](ellerslie#michaels-avenue) cell site, [250 Saint Johns Road](saint-johns#350-saint-johns-road) cell site and
[Waimarie Street](saint-heliers#waimarie-street) cell site. They also provided 2G and 3G services from here as well.
Telecom were also present at this site with their services line-fed via the nearby Glendowie exchange.

Here is a picture of both current and former cell sites. Telecom relocated to a site pretty much just around the
corner!
