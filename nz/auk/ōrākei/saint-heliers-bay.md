# Saint Heliers Bay

## Saint Heliers Bay Road

* **Date:** Unknown *(prior to 5 July 2004)*
* **Operator:** Vodafone

Cell site as it was before the 3G upgrade project. Just a pair of onmi-directional antennas and a microwave link to
the [Waimarie Street](saint-heliers#waimarie-street) cell site.

The first sign of change coming was the addition of panel antennas.

* **Date:** 5 July 2004

I beleive by this point the cell site had gone live on the new set of antennas for both 2G and 3G services.

View from within the Saint Heliers Shopping Village on Saint Heliers Bay Road. Most photos on this page were taken from
Turua Street.

View of an onmi-directional antenna which had been relocated to make place for the installation of the panel antennas.
This was a tempoary arrangement until services went live on the new set of antennas and the omni-directional antennas
were no longer needed.

* **Date:** 2 September 2008

Omni-directional antennas now gone. However from this picture you can see one of the omni-directional antennas used by
Telecom next door.

* **Date:** 7 January 2016

Picture from the last days of Vodafone's presence at this site. Note the new microwave dish as the old one would have
struggled to provide enough capacity for modern mobile phone traffic! The site would not much later be relocated to
a line-fed lightpole cell site.
