# Mission Bay

* [Marau Crescent](#marau-crescent)
* [Tagalad Road](#tagalad-road)
* [61-63 Tamaki Road](#61-63-tamaki-road)

## Marau Crescent

* **Date:** 7 May 2010

Tempoary cell site being used while the cell site was converted from onmi-directional antennas to panel antennas. Note
how they even moved the the foodlights onto the tempoary structure to make sure the tennis club could continue to play
at night!

## Tagalad Road

* **Date:** Unknown *(between 1 December 2003 and 28 August 2005)*

Note 900 MHz antennas for 2G on right have been replaced with new 2100 MHz antennas for 3G.

* **Date:** 28 August 2005
* **Operator:** Vodafone and Woosh

Note addition of Woosh antenna in centre. Note also the mounting bracket for a microwave dish. Interestingly, this was
never used, making this site one of two line-fed Woosh sites that I know of. Woosh did go to the effort to register for
a licence to operate a microwave link but cancelled soon after so that must have been the original plan.

## 61-63 Tamaki Road

* **Date:** 27 October 2015
* **Operator:** 2degrees

I was fairly surprised to see 2degrees launched in 2009 with two cell sites in the Mission Bay area, an area both Spark
and Vodafone manage to make do with just one site (although Vodafone has a microcell just for 2G capacity which is
pretty much redundant these days since most of the traffic is now 3G and 4G).

I was not too surprised when I later observed that 2degrees had replaced two big panel antennas (located on Ruan Tahi
restaurant on the left in this photo) with two microcell panel antennas (located between Ruan Thai and Servilles). This
represents a better use of resources.

The other side of the building still has the same original antenna. There is also a dish antenna pointing towards the
[Tagalad Road](#tagalad-road) site. This microwave link is barely just over a block long—one of the shortest links on
the 2degrees network I'd think!
