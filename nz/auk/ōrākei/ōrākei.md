## Coates Avenue

* **Date:** 31 July 2004
* **Operator:** Vodafone (backhaul only)

This site had only two Vodafone dish antennas. This was a relay station between the isolated [38 Reihana
Street](ōkahu-bay#38-reihana-street) cell site and their microwave hub at Kepa Road. It wasn't until some years later
that Vodafone would start to use this site for mobile services as well.

Old 900 MHz panel antennas on left with new 900 MHz panel antennas on right. The old 900 MHz antennas would eventually
be replaced with new 2100 MHz panel antennas for the 3G service. Also note there are two dish antennas. One antenna was
an old antenna unsuited for the traffic requirements of the 3G service and thus replaced with a new higher capacity
antenna.

Telecom antennas on top of building. Vodafone antennas on side (see right). The Vodafone antennas at this site seems to
be somehow line-fed from the [105-111 Kepa Road](#105-111-kepa-road) site opposite the road.
