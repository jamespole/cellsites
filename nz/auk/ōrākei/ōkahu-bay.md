## 38 Reihana Street

* **Date:** 23 May 2004
* **Operator:** Vodafone

Cell site based at a sewerage station. Note old omni-directional antenna on the left, replaced with two new panel
antennas on either ends. The new antennas were installed as part of upgrades to enable 3G services at this site. There
is a dish antenna pointing towards the [Coates Avenue](ōrākei#coates-avenue) site.

* **Date:** 28 August 2005

Vodafone equipment cabinets. The one on the right is the older type, proably used to support GSM 900 MHz services while
the one on the left is newer and probably used to support UMTS 2100 Mhz services.

* **Date:** 27 December 2010

The sewer upgrade project mentioned above saw Vodafone relocated on top of the new pump station.

The microwave dish survived the relocation.

Strangely there is an unused antenna on the other side of the pump station that is not connected to anything.
