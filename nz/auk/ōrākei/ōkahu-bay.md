* **Date:** 1 July 2009
* **Operators:** NZ Communications and Telecom

**From left:** Telecom omni-directional antenna (CDMA 800 MHz), NZ Communications panel antenna (GSM 900 MHz), Telecom
omni-directional (CDMA 800 MHz) and panel (UMTS 850 MHz) antennas, Telecom omni-directional (CDMA 800 MHz) and panel
(UMTS 2100 MHz) antennas, NZ Communications panel antenna (GSM 900 MHz), Telecom panel antenna (UMTS 850 MHz) and
Telecom panel antennas (UMTS 2100 MHz). Telecom has one more panel antenna for UMTS 850 MHz at the back of the
building.

Interesting to note that both NZ Communications and Vodafone make do with two sectors (generally due west and due
south) for their panel antennas. However Telecom had a third sector pointing directly into the cliff behind the
building.

## 38 Reihana Street

* **Date:** 23 May 2004
* **Operator:** Vodafone

Cell site based at a sewerage station. Note old omni-directional antenna on the left, replaced with two new panel
antennas on either ends. The new antennas were installed as part of upgrades to enable 3G services at this site. There
is a dish antenna pointing towards the [Coates Avenue](ōrākei#coates-avenue) site.

Vodafone equipment cabinets. The one on the right is the older type, proably used to support GSM 900 MHz services while
the one on the left is newer and probably used to support UMTS 2100 Mhz services.

Around this time a major sewer upgrade project started which would later see this cell site relocated.

* **Date:** 27 December 2010

The sewer upgrade project mentioned above saw Vodafone relocated on top of the new pump station.

The microwave dish survived the relocation.

Strangely there is an unused antenna on the other side of the pump station that is not connected to anything.
