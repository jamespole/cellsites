Eight years to the day I originally visited this cell site in 2007 I made another visit. The most obvious change is the reduction in antennas! [Orange] and [T-Mobile] merged to become [EE]. [EE] and [Three] have a joint venture called Mobile Broadband Network Limited (MBNL). This meant that one set of antennas for MBNL replaced what was previously three sets of antennas for [Orange], [Three] and [T-Mobile]. This leaves only [Vodafone] as the only operator remaning from my last visit!
