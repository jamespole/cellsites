## Antennas

Spark sites providing UMTS 850 MHz and UMTS 2100 MHz services may have three antennas for each sector (i.e. nine
antennas total for a typical three-sector site). One thin antenna will be for the 2100 MHz service and two fatter
antennas will be for the 850 MHz service. This configuration was common prior to the rollout of LTE services.

## Signs

Newer Spark cell sites have signs like the following. Note these include the site number and name.

Some Spark cell sites bult during the time of Telecom ownership may have signs like the following. Note that many
Telecom cell sites did not have those signs so the absence of any signs at all is a good indicator of a Spark cell
site.

## Telephone Exchanges

Many older cell sites built during the time of Telecom ownership were built next to telephone exchanges.
