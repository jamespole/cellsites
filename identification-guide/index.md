## Woosh

Woosh is no longer operating in most of the areas it used to operate in. However many of their equipment are still in
situ in major cities. Some have since been removed, usually due to the land owner redeveloping the land.

Some Woosh cell sites have a warning sign similar to the below on or near their cabinet.

Woosh, as a new entrant, often co-located with another operator. When they co-located on a tower, their eqipment would
typically be placed below the host operator.

Woosh almost always used cabinets to house their equipment, typically cream coloured.

However sometimes they are green. Note the warning sign on this cabinet.
