# Cell Sites

Welcome to my collection of cell site photos. I have been taking photos of cell sites since 2003. My interest was
sparked by my natural curiosity in how things work. I wanted to find out how mobile phones worked. I discovered that
other people had their own collections of cell site photos. So I decided I would create my own.

My collection contains photos of over 290 cell sites in six countries. My collection is my own work. You are free to

not compatible with the license (i.e. commercial use) please contact me.
