### 2degrees

2degrees sites usually use Huwawei cabinets which can be seen on the left in the below photo. Note that Spark has started using their cabinets as well in recent times. Some sites also have another cabinet for the power supply which is shown on the right in the photo below.

### Spark

Many older Spark NZ cell sites built during the time of Telecom ownership were built next to telephone exchanges.

Some cell sites had shipping containers to house the base station gear.

Some older Vodafone NZ cell sites built during the time of BellSouth owership will have a power meter labelled `BELL SOUTH`. These older cell sites often have the ability to be powered from an external generator via a power socket.

### Woosh

Woosh is no longer operating in most of the areas it used to operate in. However many of their equipment are still in situ in major cities. Some have since been removed, usually due to the land owner redeveloping the land.

Woosh, as a new entrant, often co-located with another operator. When they co-located on a tower, their eqipment would typically be placed below the host operator.

Woosh almost always used cabinets to house their equipment.
